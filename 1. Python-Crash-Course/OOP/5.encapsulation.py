# Encapsulation
# Public, private, protected access modifiers
#   - public: accessible from anywhere
#   - private: accessible only from inside the class 
#   - protected: accessible only from inside the class and from its subclasses but also can be accessed from outside the class but it a convention not to call protected methods from outside the class
#  -private: created using __ (two underscores) before the variable name
#  -protected: created using _ (one underscore) before the variable name
